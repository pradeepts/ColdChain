**Note**: Refer the **User Guide Document** to interact with Cold Chain Solution. You can user the User Guide Document to create, monitor and track the shipments at a pallet, carton, box and a unit level. The Cold Chain Solution allows to monitor the near real-time humidity, temperature, shock & vibration and tamper status of the various artifacts in the shipment.

## 3.	Security

### 3.1.	Storage Security

#### 3.1.1.	Secure Transfer Required

The **Secure transfer required** option enhances the security of your storage account by only allowing requests to the account from secure connections. For example, when you're calling REST APIs to access your storage account, you must connect by using HTTPS. "Secure transfer required" rejects requests that use HTTP.

In storage account overview click on configuration enabled the secure transfer required and click on save.

#### 3.1.2.	Advanced Threat Protection

Azure Storage Advanced Threat Protection detects anomalies in account activity and notifies you of potentially harmful attempts to access your account. This layer of protection allows you to address threats without the need to be a security expert or manage security monitoring systems. 

In storage account overview click on advanced treat protection select on and click on save. 

![alt text](https://github.com/SecureColdChain/ColdChain/blob/master/Documentation/images/A04.png)

#### 3.1.3.	Shared Access Key

A shared access signature provides delegated access to resources in your storage account. With a SAS, you can grant clients access to resources in your storage account, without sharing your account keys. This is the key point of using shared access signatures in your applications--a SAS is a secure way to share your storage resources without compromising your account keys.

![alt text](https://github.com/SecureColdChain/ColdChain/blob/master/Documentation/images/A06.png)

#### 3.1.4.	Encryption

One way that the Azure storage platform protects your data is via Storage Service Encryption (SSE), which encrypts your data when writing it to storage, and decrypts your data when retrieving it. The encryption and decryption is automatic, transparent, and uses 256-bit AES encryption, one of the strongest block ciphers available. 

On the Settings blade for the storage account, click Encryption. Select the Use your own key option.

You can specify your key either as a URI, or by selecting the key from a key vault.

### 3.2.	SQL Database Security

#### 3.2.1.	Advanced data security

Advanced data security (ADS) provides a set of advanced SQL security capabilities, including data discovery & classification, vulnerability assessment, and threat detection.

**vulnerability assessment**

* It helps to Assess, track, and improve the security of SQL databases, in Azure and on-prem.

**Configure vulnerability assessment:**

1.	Click on the Advanced Security and to enable ADS for all databases on the database server or managed instance, click **Enable Advanced Data Security on the server.**

![alt text](https://github.com/SecureColdChain/ColdChain/blob/master/Documentation/images/A015.png)

![alt text](https://github.com/SecureColdChain/ColdChain/blob/master/Documentation/images/A016.png)

2.	Click on the Vulnerability Assessment

![alt text](https://github.com/SecureColdChain/ColdChain/blob/master/Documentation/images/A017.png)

3.	To start using vulnerability assessment, you need to configure a storage account where scan results are saved. 

![alt text](https://github.com/SecureColdChain/ColdChain/blob/master/Documentation/images/A018.png)

4.	Select or create a storage account for saving scan results. You can also turn on periodic recurring scans to configure vulnerability assessment to run automatic scans once per week. A scan result summary is sent to the email address(es) you provide.

![alt text](https://github.com/SecureColdChain/ColdChain/blob/master/Documentation/images/A019.png)

5.	Threat protection provides a new layer of security, which enables customers to detect and respond to potential threats as they occur by providing security alerts on anomalous activities.

![alt text](https://github.com/SecureColdChain/ColdChain/blob/master/Documentation/images/A020.png)

If we configured vulnerability assessment and Threat protection, now we can go and check Scan.

**Click on the Scan and View the report**

  * The report presents an overview of your security state: how many issues were found and their respective severities. Results include warnings on deviations from best practices and a snapshot of your security-related settings, such as database principals and roles and their associated permissions.

![alt text](https://github.com/SecureColdChain/ColdChain/blob/master/Documentation/images/A021.png)

Analyze the results and resolve issues

![alt text](https://github.com/SecureColdChain/ColdChain/blob/master/Documentation/images/A022.png)

**Set your baseline**

Once you have established your baseline security state, VA only reports on deviations from the baseline and you can focus your attention on the relevant issues.

![alt text](https://github.com/SecureColdChain/ColdChain/blob/master/Documentation/images/A023.png)

#### 3.2.2.	Azure SQL Database data discovery & classification

* Discovering and classifying your most sensitive data (business, financial, healthcare, personally identifiable data.

* The Overview tab includes a summary of the current classification state of the database, including a detailed list of all classified columns, which you can also filter to view only specific schema parts, information types and labels. If you haven’t yet classified any columns.

1.	Navigate to Advanced Data Security under the Security heading in your Azure SQL Database pane. Click to enable advanced data security, and then click on the Data discovery & classification (preview) card.

![alt text](https://github.com/SecureColdChain/ColdChain/blob/master/Documentation/images/A024.png)

![alt text](https://github.com/SecureColdChain/ColdChain/blob/master/Documentation/images/A025.png)

3.	To begin classifying your data, click on the **Classification tab** at the top of the window.

![alt text](https://github.com/SecureColdChain/ColdChain/blob/master/Documentation/images/A026.png)

4.	You can also **manually classify** columns as an alternative, or in addition, to the recommendation-based classification:

* Click on **Add classification** in the top menu of the window. 

![alt text](https://github.com/SecureColdChain/ColdChain/blob/master/Documentation/images/A027.png)

#### 3.2.3.	Auditing

Audit logs helps monitor data and keep track of potential security breaches or internal misuses of information. 

**Set up auditing for your database**

1.	Navigate to **Auditing** under the Security heading in your SQL database/server pane.

![alt text](https://github.com/SecureColdChain/ColdChain/blob/master/Documentation/images/A028.png)

2.	Switch auditing ON and You now have multiple options for configuring where audit logs will be written.

*	You now have multiple options for configuring where audit logs will be written. You can write logs to an Azure storage account, to a Log Analytics workspace for consumption by Log Analytics, or to event hub for consumption using event hub. You can configure any combination of these options, and audit logs will be written to each.
If you prefer to enable auditing on the Server level, switch **Auditing** to **OFF**.

   (Or)

If you prefer to enable auditing on the database level, switch **Auditing** to **ON**.

![alt text](https://github.com/SecureColdChain/ColdChain/blob/master/Documentation/images/A029.png)

3.	Fill all the details and click Save.

![alt text](https://github.com/SecureColdChain/ColdChain/blob/master/Documentation/images/A030.png)

![alt text](https://github.com/SecureColdChain/ColdChain/blob/master/Documentation/images/A033.png)

#### 3.2.4.	Transparent data encryption for SQL Database and Data Warehouse

*	Transparent data encryption (TDE) helps protect Azure SQL Database, Azure SQL Managed Instance, and Azure Data Warehouse against the threat of malicious activity.

*	It performs real-time encryption and decryption of the database, associated backups, and transaction log files at rest without requiring changes to the application.

*	Transparent data encryption encrypts the storage of an entire database by using a symmetric key called the database encryption key.

*	This database encryption key is protected by the transparent data encryption protector.

*	The protector is either a service-managed certificate (service-managed transparent data encryption) or an asymmetric key stored in Azure Key Vault (Bring Your Own Key). 

1.	You turn transparent data encryption on and off on the database level. 

![alt text](https://github.com/SecureColdChain/ColdChain/blob/master/Documentation/images/A034.png)

2.	You set the transparent data encryption master key, also known as the transparent data encryption protector, on the server level. 

*	To use transparent data encryption with Bring Your Own Key support and protect your databases with a key from Key Vault, open the transparent data encryption settings under your server.

#### 3.2.5.	SQL Database dynamic data masking

Dynamic data masking helps prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data by enabling customers to designate how much of the sensitive data to reveal with minimal impact on the application layer. It’s a policy-based security feature that hides the sensitive data in the result set of a query over designated database fields, while the data in the database is not changed.

**Examples**

| **Masking Function**           | **Masking Logic**       
| -------------              | -------------                                                                                                                              
| **Credit card**       | Masking method, which exposes the last four digits of the designated fields and adds a constant string as a prefix in the form of a credit card.  XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-1234  
| **Email**            | Masking method, which exposes the first letter and replaces the domain with XXX.com using a constant string prefix in the form of an email address.   aXX@XXXX.com

## 6. Performing DR Strategies

### 6.1. Standard Solution Type


In this scenario, there is again a primary and a secondary Azure region. All the traffic goes to the active deployment on the primary region. The secondary region is better prepared for disaster recovery because the database is running on both regions. 

Only the primary region has a deployed cloud service application. Both regions are synchronized with the contents of the database. When a disaster occurs, there are fewer activation requirements. You redeploy Azure resources in the secondary region.

Redeployment approach, you should have already stored the service packages. However, you don’t incur most of the overhead that database restore operation requires, because the database is ready and running.  This saves a significant amount of time, making this an affordable DR pattern.

Standard Solution requires redeployment of Azure resources in secondary region when the primary region is down.
When user chooses Standard Solution type below Azure resources will be deployed 

*	Web Apps

*	Function App 

*	Application insights

*	Azure Cosmos DB

*	IoT Hub

*	Storage Account 

*	Document DB

*	SQL Server

*	Log analytics

*	Azure Active Directory

*	Automation Account

*	Stream Analytics 

*	TMT-VM 

*	API Management

When Primary region is down, and user needs to redeploy Azure resources to new region. Once redeployment gets completed below resources will get deployed.

*	Web App

*	Function App
